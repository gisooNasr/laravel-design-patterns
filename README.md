# About factory design pattern

Imagine you have this cool logistics management app that started with handling only truck transportation. As your app gains popularity, sea transportation companies are reaching out to you, asking to add sea logistics to your app.

To make this happen without causing chaos in your code, the Factory Method pattern comes to the rescue! Instead of directly creating objects with the new operator, you create a special factory method. It's like having a magic factory where you can request different types of transportation objects without messing up your existing Truck class. These objects, known as products, allow you to smoothly manage various transportation types and keep your app growing seamlessly!
