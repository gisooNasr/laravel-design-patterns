# About mediator Design Pattern

Picture the Mediator pattern as a peacekeeper in the world of objects. It's like having a cool mediator friend that prevents chaos and fights between objects.

Instead of letting objects talk directly to each other, the Mediator pattern suggests a better approach. Objects can now only communicate through the mediator friend. It's like having a middle person who redirects messages to the right recipients. As a result, objects only need to know and trust this mediator friend, and they don't have to know about all their other colleagues.

In our example with the profile editing form, the dialog class acts as this awesome mediator friend. It knows all the sub-elements, so they don't need to worry about talking to each other directly. It's like magic – the components collaborate smoothly, thanks to the mediator friend! 🧙‍♀️🧙‍♂️
