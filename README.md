# About repository design pattern

this pattern allows you to use objects without having to know how these objects are persisted. In another words it's an abstraction of the data layer.
A repository can be described as a layer of abstraction between the domain and data mapping layers, one that provides an avenue of mediation between both, via a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.
This means that your business logic doesnâ€™t need to know how data is retrieved or what the source of the data is. The business logic relies on the repository to retrieve the correct data.
