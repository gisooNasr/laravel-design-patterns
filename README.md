# About builder design pattern

The Builder pattern comes to the rescue when you have a class that has nifty internal methods, which modify the behavior of the class object and return the object itself.

In simpler terms, it's like playing with Lego blocks! You can use the class and chain its methods together, adding awesome features one after the other, just like building your dream Lego creation piece by piece.

So, with the Builder pattern, you have the power to customize your class object step-by-step, making it super flexible and easy to use. It's like having a magical toolkit that lets you create the perfect object tailored to your needs! ðŸš€ðŸ§±
