# About Strategy Design Pattern

Strategy , being a behavioral design pattern, is like a magician that transforms behaviors into objects, making them easily swapable in the main context. The main context is like the conductor, holding a ticket to a strategy object. It passes the baton to the strategy object, letting it perform the magic trick. And guess what? You can switch strategies by swapping the magician, which means you can change how the main context does its thing just by bringing in another magician to do the trick. Pretty cool, right?
