# About singleton design pattern

Hey there! Let's talk about the Singleton design pattern - it's like having a VIP pass for classes! With this pattern, you ensure that a class has only one special instance that everyone can access globally.

In our case, we use the Singleton pattern to make sure we have just one UserRepository instance throughout our awesome app. Meet the UserRepositorySingleton, the mastermind behind this magic! It's responsible for creating and taking care of our UserRepository. So, no matter where we are in the app, we're always dealing with the same UserRepository instance.

And guess what? This not only makes things faster but also keeps our data consistent, making it a super useful pattern for all kinds of scenarios! It's like having a trusty sidekick that's always there when you need it! 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♂️
